Fallout Terminal - React

This is a simple fallout terminal app I made using React. I used CSS from https://codepen.io/mackorichardson/pen/vNMRpK (CodePen - Mack Richardson) as a starting point, but made some customizations to suit my needs. For those unacquainted - Fallout is a post-apocalytic videogame that includes retro-style computers, which this app seeks to mimic.

Feel free to use this in your own projects if you like!
